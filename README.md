# Project
Mitigation of Ddos attack using ML algorithms
Mitigation of DDos Attack is BE level project in this we have designed
a network which classify the attacks as normal and malicious traffic.
Here, we are mitigating the malicious which harms our system. This
classification, detection and mitigation of these attack is done using
Machine Learning Algorithms. So network we are using here is SDN network 
which is degigned using RYU controller. The whole project designed and made on LINUX.
